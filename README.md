# PCL_GWML_demo

It is a simplified demo for the original [repository](https://github.com/stephengreen/lfi-gw/) contains the code for the paper [arXiv:2008.03312](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03312), by Stephen R. Green and Jonathan Gair.

This code uses the [nflows](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows) package to implement the normalizing flow, which we take to be a [neural spline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03712) flow. It makes use of the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) machine learning framework.

Just read and run all the codes in [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/iphysresearch/PCL_GWML_demo/blob/master/demo.ipynb).
